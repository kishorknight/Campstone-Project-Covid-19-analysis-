# Statistical Analysis of Covid-19 Lockdown Measures

## Project Overview
This project is a capstone achievement of the data science training program at SkilloVilla. It serves as an evaluation of the skills acquired throughout the training, demonstrating their application in solving 
real-world problems. The capstone project integrates multiple data science concepts to address a critical issue: the impact of lockdown measures on the spread of Covid-19.

## Background
The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had devastating consequences on social, economic, and environmental sustainability. As of March 11, 2022, the virus has caused over 6 million deaths 
worldwide. Governments across the globe have implemented various lockdown measures to contain the virus, enforce public safety, and mitigate economic collapse.

Despite these measures, there is growing evidence that certain lockdown restrictions do not significantly impact the number of daily cases. This project aims to analyze the relationship between lockdown measures 
and daily Covid-19 cases in India using statistical methods and data analysis techniques.

## Problem Statement
Lockdowns are widely implemented to control the spread of Covid-19, assuming they will reduce infections. However, scientific studies suggest that not all measures have a direct impact on daily case numbers.
For example, research indicates that closing schools does not significantly affect infections among children.

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
1. To evaluate the effectiveness of different lockdown measures in controlling daily Covid-19 cases.
2. To identify socio-economic impacts of unnecessary lockdown restrictions.
3. To derive insights that can aid in formulating effective and balanced pandemic response strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the World Bank, which provides date-wise daily Covid-19 cases in India. The dataset includes various lockdown measures implemented over time. A detailed
explanation of each column and its scale is available at Covid-19 Data Hub Documentation

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     - Understanding data distribution and trends.
     - Handling missing values and inconsistencies.
     - Visualizing key features.
2. Statistical Analysis:
    - Identifying correlations between lockdown measures and daily cases.
    - Evaluating the statistical significance of lockdown measures.
    - Extracting meaningful insights from the data.
3. Performance Evaluation:
    - Comparing different lockdown measures to assess their effectiveness.
    - Drawing conclusions supported by statistical evidence.

## Conclusion
This project aims to bridge the gap between lockdown policies and their actual effectiveness by using statistical analysis. The insights gained will contribute to better decision-making in future pandemic 
responses, helping governments implement data-driven policies that balance public health and socio-economic stability.
